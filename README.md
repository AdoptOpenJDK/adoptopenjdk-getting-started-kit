** All instructions and tips below are for the general public and attendees of hackdays / workshops / hands-on-sessions - except for the one about the Custom JUG handout template, which is for JUG leaders and organisers. **

This document is meant to make it easier for developers to get started with OpenJDK and refers to in as many places to cannonical sources like http://adoptopenjdk.java.net and http://http://openjdk.java.net/, and in no way trying to replace these resources.

Please read and implement the below when attending the presentation or hands-on session!
