This document is meant to make it easier for "first time" developers to get started with OpenJDK and refers to, in as many places as possible, to cannonical sources like http://adoptopenjdk.java.net and http://openjdk.java.net/, and does not override or replace these resources.

**Known issue with GitBooks.IO**: some markdown links are returning a ```404 error``` when you click on the link, removing the trailing ```null``` text from the url fixes the problem. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/GitbookIO/documentation/issues/17) and is affecting the UX of this book, and has been reported to the author, our apologies for the inconvenience.
