# Contributors

This e-book previously contained in two Google docs i.e. [Adopt OpenJDK Getting Started Kit](http://bit.ly/17ovGUB) and [Adopt OpenJDK Intermediate & Advance experiences document](http://bit.ly/1ckphOl) is a result of community contributions from all across the world.

The document has grown especially during hackdays in London (host at the @salesforce office - support by @ljcjuc, @salesforce, @heroku, and @jr0cket).

Hack-a-thons, hacktergarten and workshops held at various conferences across Europe have also helped developed them further.

Below is a list of contributors both individuals and groups (in no particular order):
- LJC (various members all those who came to our hackdays)
- BGJUG ()
