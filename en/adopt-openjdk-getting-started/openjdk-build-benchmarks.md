# OpenJDK Build Benchmarks
##### build-infra (Nov 2011) by Fredrik Öhrström, ex-Oracle, OpenJDK hero!

*Fredrik Öhrström* visited the LJC in November 2011 where he showed us how to build OpenJDK on the three major platforms, and also distributed a four page leaflet with the benchmarks of the various components and how long they took to build. The new build system and the new makefiles are a result  of the build system being re-written (build-infra). Below are screen-shots of the leaflets, a good reference to compare our journey:
