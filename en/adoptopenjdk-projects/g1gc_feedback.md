# G1GC feedback

The hotspot team are looking for feedback on the new G1GC collector, now default in Java 9, see https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/G1GC+Feedback on further information on how to go about with it.

Also see [OpenJDK Early Access](../binaries/openjdk_early_access.md) and other sections in the vook to find out how you can build a JDK image, so you can experiment and test out the G1GC collector.
