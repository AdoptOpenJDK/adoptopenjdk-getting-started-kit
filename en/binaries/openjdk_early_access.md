**JDK 8 Early Access**

To get hold of just the binaries for Java (JDK8) go to the [download site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.

If you take this route, then most of the contents of this document wonâ€™t apply to you. But you can use the JDK8 features by writing programs that take advantage of them, i.e. using Lambdas.
