This e-book previously contained in two Google docs i.e. [Adopt OpenJDK Getting Started Kit](http://bit.ly/17ovGUB) and [Adopt OpenJDK Intermediate & Advance experiences document](http://bit.ly/1ckphOl) is a result of community contributions from all across the world.

The document has grown especially during hackdays in London (host at the @salesforce office - support by @ljcjuc, @salesforce, @heroku, @hackthetower and @jr0cket).

    - and many members who participated at the hackdays
