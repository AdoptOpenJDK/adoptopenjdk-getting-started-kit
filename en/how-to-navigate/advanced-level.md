### Advanced level

##### I'm an expert / very regular at OpenJDK hackdays, know a lot about tech/Java/JVM/OpenJDK, what do you have for me ?

- Go through [this section](how-to-navigate/advanced-level.md) slowly.

- If you are done, take look at the [Table of Content](http://neomatrix369.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/content/) and then check to see if you have not tried anything out yet.
