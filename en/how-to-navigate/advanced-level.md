##### I'm very experienced / regular at the OpenJDK hackdays, know a lot about tech/Java/JVM/OpenJDK, what do you have for me ?

- [Command-line arguments for build performance optimisation](../advanced-steps/command-line_arguments_for_build_performance_optimisation.md)
- Go through the [Advanced steps](../advanced-steps/advanced_steps.md) at a slow pace.
- Finally when you are done with the above, take a look at the [Table of Content](http://adoptopenjdk.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/content/) to see if you have not tried anything from the list.
