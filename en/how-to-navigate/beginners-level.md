### Beginners level

##### I'm a student / progressional beginner, new to OpenJDK, want to learn, never been to OpenJDK hackdays before, where do I start ?

- * [Adopt OpenJDK - Getting started](adopt-openjdk-getting-started/adopt_openjdk_-_getting_started.md) - read through the pages and sub-pages briefly, read them in detail at home or in your spare time.
- If you are done, take a look at the [Table of Content](http://neomatrix369.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/content/) to see if you have not tried anything from the list.
