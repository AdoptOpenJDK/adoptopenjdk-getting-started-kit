### Beginners level

##### I'm a student / progressional beginner, new to OpenJDK, want to learn, never been to OpenJDK hackdays before, where do I start ?

- [Adopt OpenJDK - Getting started](../adopt-openjdk-getting-started/adopt_openjdk_-_getting_started.md) - read through the pages and sub-pages briefly, read them in detail at home or in your spare time.
- [Virtual Machines](../virtual-machines/virtual_machines.md) - run through these pages and build or download a VM depending on bandwidth availability and time. Or request for a VM image from the facilitators (see page for further instructions).
- [Build your own OpenJDK](../binaries/build_your_own_openjdk.md) - go through this section and use your VM from the previous step to build the respective version of OpenJDK.
- Either go to section [Sources Code](../source-code/source_code.md) or go to the [See directory structure of various OpenJDK projects](../intermediate-steps/see_directory_structure_of_various_openjdk_projects.md).
- Go to the next step [Intermediate level](../how-to-navigate/intermediate-level.md)
- If you are done, take a look at the [Table of Content](http://neomatrix369.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/content/) to see if you have not tried anything from the list.
