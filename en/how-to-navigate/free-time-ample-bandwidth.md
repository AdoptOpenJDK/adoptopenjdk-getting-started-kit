### I find time at home and have the bandwidth I need, how best can take advantages of this situation ?

Go through these sections at a slower pace:

* [Adopt OpenJDK - Getting started](../adopt-openjdk-getting-started/adopt_openjdk_-_getting_started.md)
* [Virtual Machines](../virtual-machines/virtual_machines.md)
* [Binaries](../binaries/binaries.md)

If you are done, take look at the [Table of Content](http://adoptopenjdk.gitbooks.io/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/content/) and then check to see if you have not tried anything out yet.
