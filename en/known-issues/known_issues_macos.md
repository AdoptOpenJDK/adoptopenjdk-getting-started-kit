** Why does the configuration fail when freetype is not found ?**

```configure: error: Could not find freetype!  
configure exiting with result code 1```


** When we try to install freetype we find it is already installed**

```$ brew install freetype
Error: freetype-2.5.3_1 already installed
To install this version, first `brew unlink freetype’```

*Solutuon: since it is already installed we configure like this:*

```$ bash configure –with-freetype-include=/usr/X11/include/freetype2 –with-freetype-lib=/usr/X11/lib
```
A new configuration has been successfully created in
