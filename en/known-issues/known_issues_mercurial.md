# Mercurial

**My OpenJDK8 does not build, why? I get an “Http: Error 404: Not Found”.**

There has been a change to the address to mercurial repo for openjdk8, its changed from hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/tl to http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8

jdk8 Updates are available from 
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u

All hg clone commands should use the latter address, a solution to the problem can be found below under Download source by running... (```#heading=h.fuqz6rlsthji```).


**I get an “HTTP Error 404: Not Found” when downloading sources  (when I run ./get_sources.sh) for the various repos**

*Fix 1*

Edit all the .hg/hgrc file in the root repo ($HOME/SOURCE/jdk8_tl) along with those in repos hotspot, jaxws, jaxp, corba, nashorn, jdk, langtools, and change all references to .../tl/... to .../jdk8/… For example, change the below setting,

```
default = hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/tl/hotspot
```
to 
```
default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/hotspot
```
in the hotspot repo, and save the file. Rename the jdk8_tl folder to jdk8:

```
$ cd ..
$ mv jdk8_tl jdk8
```

- or -

*Fix 2*
```
$ cd ..

$ mv jdk8_tl jdk8_tl_backup

$ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8

$ cd jdk8

$ chmod u+x get_source.sh

$ ./get_source.sh

$ bash configure
```

When the above steps work, remove the backup folder with

```
$ rm -fr jdk8_tl_backup
```

All references to jdk8_tl will change to jdk8.
