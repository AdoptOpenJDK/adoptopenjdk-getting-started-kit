# Project Shenandoah

Shenandoah has been accepted as OpenJDK project.

Shenandoah will use OpenJDK infrastructure for hosting
Shenandoah development:

1. Use http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/shenandoah-dev as
mailing list for discussions and development.

2. Use https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main as wiki.

3. Code repositories are http://hg.openjdk.java.net/shenandoah

You will notice that there's a JDK9 *and* JDK8 branch in there. Both
will be maintained.

The Mercurial history will remain on Icedtea servers, should anybody be interested in it.


Download JDK/JRE binaries for **Project Shenandoah**, from the **Adopt OpenJDK Cloudbees build farm** [Shenandoah - JDK8](https://adopt-openjdk.ci.cloudbees.com/view/OpenJDK/job/project-shenandoah-jdk8/) and 
[Shenandoah - JDK9](https://adopt-openjdk.ci.cloudbees.com/view/OpenJDK/job/project-shenandoah-jdk9/).
