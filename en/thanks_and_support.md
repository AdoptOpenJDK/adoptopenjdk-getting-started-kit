# Thanks and Support

Thanks to **London Java Community**, its founder [Barry Cranford](http://twitter.com/bcrecworks), and JUG leaders [Martijn Verburg](http://twitter.com/karianna) & [Ben Evans](http://twitter.com/kittylyst) who are not going to be present at the event but their support has brought about all the material and experience to share with the the rest of you!

Also you would like to know that [RecWorks](http://www.recworks.co.uk/) has been supporting LJC with all events and presentation activities, since the inception of the community.

Thanks to [SouJava](http://soujava.org.br/) for helping us to get this book translated into Portuguese.

Not forgetting Oracle for its Open Source spirit & support!
