##### I know something that I want to share, want to contribute to this book ?

Do the below and you can immediately start contributing via the github collaboration model:

clone the repo **git@github.com:neomatrix369/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit.git**, make your amendments, and create a pull request

or 

You can also [contact](https://www.gitbook.com/book/neomatrix369/adoptopenjdk-getting-started-kit/contact) the authors with your github username to be added to the repo.

Some [documentation](http://help.gitbook.com/) and [how to install GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) locally should also help in the process.
