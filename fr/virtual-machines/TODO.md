## TODO
(intentionnellement laiss√© en anglais)

1. In the sharing_host_folder.md, get command-line version of network config working, should be more consistent.


###[2. Old info re using VM's shared folder, to hide, maybe get this working and resurrect later]
Create a folder on host machine such as ```~/Public/Java```

Make sure that the Ubuntu VM has guest additions installed:
 - From the menu choose: Device  then  Insert guest CD
 - This should then auto-run.

Add a shared folder to the VM. For "Folder path" browse to the shared folder you created above (eg ```~/Public/Java```)
If this displays a blank window, you might need to press ENTER (the blank window is a confirmation dialogue)

In the VM, cd into the shared folder shown above (eg ```cd /media/sf_Java```), then fetch and build the Java source as described above [Building your own OpenJDK](../binaries/build_your_own_openjdk.md).
 - This might require root to allow this, if the  cd  command fails with "Permission denied" then try:  ```sudo -i```
 - TODO Ideally remove this limitation, would be good to run as non-root. An alternative could be to  share the guest's home folder using SMB and map to it from host, some research and configuring is required here, and it has the disadvantage that the VM would need to be running in order to access the jdk source files.
