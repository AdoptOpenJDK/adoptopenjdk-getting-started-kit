# Virtual Machine

**My VM disk is full since I installed xxx / have been building yyyy? What do I do?**

The ‘build’ folder in jdk8_tl and jdk9 take up a lot of disk space - sometimes upto 3GB, and if not required after building it, can be removed. In the beginning when learning about the system, you won’t need both jdk8 and jdk9 built. 

If you still need more disk space, use the above solution to increase the size of the disk.
