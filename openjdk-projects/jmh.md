JMH is a microbenchmarking tool for Java and other JVM languages. 

A microbenchmark is an attempt to measure the performance of a "mico" portion of the code. These tests are typically in the nanosecond range with thousands of executions.  The tested code usually performs a small task. 

Microbenchmarking is not same as   profiling! 

When profiling, you work with full app either in production or some similar environment.

When you microbenchmark, you get a result that is  fictional since it is very different from a production environment.
