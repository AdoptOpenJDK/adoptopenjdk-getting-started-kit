# Penrose

Considering that the old Jigsaw JDK8 EA build is now dropped Penrose sources are currently outdated and the project is still in exploratory phase. 

However you can inspect old forest under penrose/jigsaw (http://hg.openjdk.java.net/penrose/jigsaw/) and penrose/penrose (http://hg.openjdk.java.net/penrose/penrose/) [for some demos].
