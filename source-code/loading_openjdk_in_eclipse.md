# Eclipse

To view / edit Java source files from Eclipse:
 - Create a new Java Project
 - Untick "Use default location" 
 - Browse to the jdk/ folder, which contains the src, make and test folders. For example /home/openjdk/dev/jdk9/jdk on a Ubuntu VM, or smb://server/user/dev/jdk9/jdk if you are using a share from VM into the host machine. Press OK and be patient.
 
 

 - 
 - (eg ~/Public/Java
Then expand the selected path and tick just the src/ and test/ sub-folders

Now you can edit in Eclipse and build in the Ubuntu VM.
