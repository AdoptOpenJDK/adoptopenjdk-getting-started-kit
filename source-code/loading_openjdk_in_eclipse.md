# Eclipse

To view / edit Java source files from Eclipse:
 - Create a new Java Project
 - Untick "Use default location" 
 - Browse to the jdk/ folder, which contains the src, make and test folders. For example /home/openjdk/dev/jdk9/jdk on a Ubuntu VM, or smb://server/user/dev/jdk9/jdk if you are using a [share from VM into the host machine](.md). Press OK and be patient.

 * [IntelliJ](loading_openjdk_in_intellij.md)
 * [Eclipse](loading_openjdk_in_eclipse.md)
 * [Netbeans](loading_openjdk_in_netbeans.md) 
 

 - 
 - (eg ~/Public/Java
Then expand the selected path and tick just the src/ and test/ sub-folders

Now you can edit in Eclipse and build in the Ubuntu VM.
