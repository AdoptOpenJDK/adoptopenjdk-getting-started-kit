Thanks to **London Java Community**, its founder Barry Cranford, and JUG leaders [Martijn Verburg](http://twitter.com/karianna) & [Ben Evans](http://twitter.com/kittylyst) who are not going to be present at the event but their support has brought about all the material and experience to share with the the rest of you!

Not forgetting Oracle for its Open Source spirit & support!
